# Pricing Treatment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the causal impact of a pricing intervention applied to selected  trade routes.  
The goal is to:
1. Estimate the effect of the treatment on **price**, **bookings**, and **revenue**.
2. Assess heterogeneity in effects across **trade clusters**.
3. Provide actionable recommendations based on the findings.

The analysis uses **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** and **Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE)** models to measure treatment effects while controlling for trade and time fixed effects.
